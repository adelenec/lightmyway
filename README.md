# lightmyway 
A shoe wearable that brings you home

## DevPost: https://devpost.com/software/light-my-way-pot3he

## Inspiration
Two of our team members have loved ones that suffer from dementia and actually experienced getting lost. It is very dangerous, and we wanted to see how we could include

## What it does
Our current prototype lights up different sections of the shoe based on keyboard input, simulating the direction that the user would need to go in based on geolocation and orientation. Ideally, we'd take into account our current location, destination, and orientation, and find a best-suited path to follow, which would be translated to lights.

## How we built it
### We used an Arduino, breadboard, led-strip, 3D-printed battery holder and a silicon-diffuser.

## Challenges we ran into
We couldn't get hold of a GPS Neo6M for our location tracking capabilities, so we spent some time trying to see how we could get current location from our web browser. It didn't end up working out, but we were able to learn more about website capabilities.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning more about Geoposition in html, LED projects and Arduinos. And being able to crank out a product in 24hrs!

## What we learned
The importance of starting small and building our way up, experimentation to learn more about our different sensors, and pivoting when necessary.

## What's next for Light My Way
Make our device more compact, connect to GPS and include a compass, include directional vibrations as an additional haptic.

## Built With
Arduino, C++, 3D Printer, Our Creativity :)
